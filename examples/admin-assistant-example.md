## 1. Plain-Language Role Summary

This role is an in-office administrative support position responsible for handling front-desk coverage, routine clerical work, and general office coordination. The position serves as the first point of contact for clients and visitors and provides day-to-day administrative assistance to multiple internal teams, while also helping maintain shared office spaces.

The role functions as general office support rather than specialized or managerial administration.

## 2. Day-to-Day Responsibilities

### Stated responsibilities

- Answering and directing incoming phone calls
- Greeting clients, contractors, delivery personnel, and staff
- Opening and closing the office as required
- Providing clerical support across departments
- Preparing documents, filing, scanning, and performing data entry
- Taking meeting notes and distributing summaries
- Supporting client communications by phone and email
- Maintaining office calendars and meeting schedules
- Managing internal communications
- Assisting staff with project-related administrative needs
- Monitoring and restocking office supplies and company materials
- Assisting with ordering supplies
- Coordinating with external cleaning services
- Maintaining shared office areas (coffee stations, dishwasher, general tidiness)

### Inferred (clearly labeled and justified)

- Task prioritization across multiple requestors  
  Inferred because the posting states that any team member may request clerical assistance, implying the need to manage competing requests independently.

- Basic triage of client and contractor inquiries  
  Inferred from being the first point of contact and being expected to understand internal roles in order to direct inquiries appropriately.

## 3. Seniority and Scope Assessment

**Seniority level:** Entry to Intermediate  
**Role type:** Individual Contributor  
**Primary focus:** Tactical / Operational support  

**Justification:**  
The role centers on routine administrative, clerical, and office-support tasks. There is no indication of decision-making authority, staff supervision, budget responsibility, or strategic planning. Responsibilities are execution-focused and service-oriented rather than managerial or advisory.

---

## 4. Classification Mapping

**Likely job family:**

- Administrative Assistant
- Office Administrator
- Receptionist (hybrid function)

**Rationale:**  
The role combines front-desk reception duties, general clerical work, and internal office coordination. While broader than a pure receptionist position, it does not rise to the level of an office manager due to the absence of staff supervision, budget authority, or operational ownership.

---

## 5. Language Risk and Inflation Check

- Elevated phrasing such as “administrative backbone” inflates perceived scope relative to the clerical and support-focused duties described.
- Statements indicating support across all projects and teams suggest a potential catch-all support role with broad, undefined demand.
- Phrases emphasizing a “fast-paced environment” and “high organization” are common but vague, offering little clarity on workload volume or prioritization rules.

**Responsibility without authority risk:**  
The role carries responsibility for supporting many individuals and maintaining office operations but does not specify authority to set priorities, decline requests, or escalate conflicts.

---

## 6. Missing or Unclear Information

- Reporting structure (who the role reports to)
- How task priorities are set when multiple teams request support
- Performance or success metrics
- Volume of calls, visitors, or administrative requests
- Team size and overall office size
- Depth of use for referenced tools or systems
- Backup coverage during absences or peak periods
- Role progression or advancement expectations

---

## 7. Candidate Fit Summary

### Strong fit if you are

- Comfortable in a support-focused role with frequent interruptions
- Organized and detail-oriented with strong follow-through
- Confident interacting with clients, contractors, and internal staff
- Willing to handle both desk work and light office upkeep tasks

### Proceed with caution if you expect

- Clearly bounded responsibilities or a narrow scope
- Authority to control workload or refuse requests
- Strategic or project ownership responsibilities
- Remote or hybrid work flexibility
- A role focused primarily on advanced administrative systems rather than general office support
